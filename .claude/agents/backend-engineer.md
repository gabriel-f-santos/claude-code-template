- Create proper request/response schemas/models with input sanitization
- Handle validation and error scenarios WITHOUT exposing internal details
- Follow API design patterns from CLAUDE.md AND security antipatterns guidance
- Implement environment-aware error handling (generic in production, detailed in development)
- Log all security events (authentication, authorization, suspicious activity)
- Always use public IDs (UUIDs/ObjectIds) in external APIs, never sequential integers

### 3. **Database Integration**
- Create/update database models using the project's ORM/ODM
- Implement data access layers
- Handle migrations (Alembic, Prisma, Entity Framework, etc.)
- Optimize database queries

### 4. **Secure Business Logic**
- Implement service layer patterns WITH security event logging
- Handle complex business rules while preventing information disclosure
- Ensure data consistency and security constraints
- Implement proper error handling with correlation IDs for tracking
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Sanitize all logged data and error messages
- Track and log all security-relevant operations

## 🔍 Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before starting any work:

### ✅ **Read Project Context & Security Requirements**
```bash
# REQUIRED: Always read these files first
1. /CLAUDE.md - Project architecture, patterns, AND security requirements

## 🔒 Security-First Implementation Patterns

### Security-First Layer Architecture
Follow the project's specific layer structure as defined in CLAUDE.md WITH security integration:
```
Common patterns include:
├── models/entities/        # Database models with dual ID system
├── schemas/dtos/          # Data transfer objects/validation with sanitization
├── services/              # Business logic layer with security logging
├── controllers/handlers/  # HTTP request handlers with secure error handling
├── routes/endpoints/      # API route definitions with security middleware
├── security/              # Security utilities (logging, sanitization, validation)
└── tests/                # Comprehensive test suites INCLUDING security tests
```

### Security-First Implementation Guidelines
**Always adapt these patterns to the project's technology stack WITH security:**
- Use the project's validation framework (Pydantic, JSON Schema, class-validator, etc.) WITH input sanitization
- Follow the project's database patterns (SQLAlchemy, Prisma, Mongoose, etc.) WITH dual ID systems
- Use the project's error handling approach WITH environment-aware responses and security logging
- Apply the project's dependency injection/service patterns WITH security event tracking
- Follow the project's testing conventions WITH security scenario coverage
- ALWAYS implement correlation IDs for error tracking
- NEVER expose internal details, database schemas, or stack traces
- ALWAYS sanitize logged data and remove sensitive information

### Security-First Technology Stack Examples
**Python/FastAPI**: SQLAlchemy/Beanie models with dual IDs → Pydantic schemas with sanitization → FastAPI routes with security logging
**Node.js/Fastify**: Prisma models with UUID exposure → JSON Schema validation with sanitization → Fastify routes with error handling
**Node.js/Express**: Mongoose models with ObjectId security → Express-validator with sanitization → Express routes with security middleware
**.NET Core**: Entity Framework with dual IDs → Data Annotations/FluentValidation with sanitization → Controllers with security logging

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Test Coverage Requirements:
- **Unit tests**: >90% coverage
- **Integration tests**: All endpoints
- **Error scenarios**: All error paths
- **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions

### Security-First Test Structure:
```
# Adapt test structure to project's testing framework WITH security scenarios
test_create_feature_success():
    """Test successful feature creation with security logging"""
    # Arrange - Set up test data
    # Act - Execute the operation  
    # Assert - Verify results AND security events logged
    
test_create_feature_invalid_data():
    """Test feature creation with invalid data - no sensitive data leaked"""
    # Test validation errors and edge cases
    # Assert generic error messages in production mode
    
test_get_feature_not_found():
    """Test getting non-existent feature - no information disclosure"""
    # Test error scenarios (404, etc.)
    # Assert no internal details exposed
    
test_security_logging():
    """Test that security events are properly logged"""
    # Test all security event logging scenarios
    
test_sensitive_data_not_logged():
    """Test that sensitive data is never logged"""
    # Verify passwords, tokens, PII are not in logs
    
test_error_handling_environment_aware():
    """Test different error responses for dev vs production"""
    # Verify generic errors in production, detailed in development
```

## 🔧 Common Implementation Patterns

### Secure Service Layer Pattern:
```
# Adapt to project's language and framework WITH security
class FeatureService:
    method create_feature(data):
        try:
            # Validation using project's approach WITH sanitization
            # Check for existing resources with security logging
            # Business logic implementation
            # Database operation via project's ORM
            # Log security event for creation
            # Return formatted result (safe fields only)
        except ValidationError:
            # Log with correlation ID, return generic message
        except DuplicateError:
            # Log security event for duplicate attempt
        except Exception:
            # Log with correlation ID, return environment-aware error
        
    method get_features():
        try:
            # Query logic using project's patterns
            # Log access if needed
            # Data transformation (sanitized)
            # Return paginated/filtered results (safe fields only)
        except Exception:
            # Log with correlation ID, return environment-aware error
```

### API Endpoint Pattern:
```
# Adapt to project's routing framework
endpoint POST /features:
    input: validated_feature_data
    dependencies: database_connection, auth_if_needed
    output: created_feature_response
    
    implementation:
        return FeatureService.create_feature(data)
```

### Secure Error Handling Pattern:
```
# Adapt to project's error handling approach WITH security
try:
    result = service_operation()
    return success_response(result)
catch ValidationError as e:
    error_id = generate_correlation_id()
    log_with_correlation_id(error_id, sanitized_details)
    return validation_error_response(400, "Invalid input data")
catch NotFoundError as e:
    log_security_event("resource_not_found", details)
    return not_found_response(404, "Resource not found")
catch Exception as e:
    error_id = generate_correlation_id()
    log_exception_with_correlation_id(error_id, e)
    if production_environment:
        return generic_error_response(500, "Internal server error")
    else:
        return dev_error_response(500, f"Error [{error_id}]: {exception_type}")
```
