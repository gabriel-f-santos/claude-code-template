# 🤖 Multi-Agent Development System

## 🎯 Overview

This is an **autonomous multi-agent system** designed to develop complete features following your project's specific architecture. Each agent is specialized in a particular domain and works together under the coordination of a **MasterAgent**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
MasterAgent (Coordinator)
    ├── DatabaseArchitect (Schema & Models)
    ├── BackendEngineer (API Development) 
    ├── FrontendEngineer (UI Development)
    ├── QAEngineer (Quality Assurance)
    └── IntegrationExpert (System Integration)
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Project-Aware Agents**
Each agent reads your project's `CLAUDE.md` to understand:
- Technology stack and frameworks
- Architecture patterns and conventions  
- Code styles and quality standards
- Testing requirements and patterns

### 2. **Coordinated Development**
- **MasterAgent** orchestrates the entire feature development
- Creates comprehensive plans in `MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md`
- Delegates specific tasks to specialized agents
- Monitors progress and ensures quality gates

### 3. **Quality-First Approach**
- Each agent follows strict quality gates
- Comprehensive testing at every layer
- Architecture compliance verification
- Performance and security validation

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project
Ensure your project has a `CLAUDE.md` file documenting:
```markdown
# Project Architecture
- Technology stack (FastAPI, React, Flutter, etc.)
- Database technology (SQLAlchemy, Prisma, Beanie)
- Testing frameworks and standards  
- Code conventions and patterns
- Quality requirements (coverage, performance)
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Requirements (Optional)
Create a PRP (Product Requirements & Plan) document:
```markdown
# Feature: User Authentication
## Objective
Implement JWT-based authentication with email/password
## Requirements  
- User registration and login endpoints
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password hashing and security
- Frontend login/register forms
## Acceptance Criteria
- 90%+ test coverage
- <200ms API response times
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance
```

### Step 3: Launch MasterAgent
```bash
# Use the MasterAgent to coordinate feature development
/agent master-agent "Develop complete user authentication feature following the architecture in CLAUDE.md"
```

### Step 4: Monitor Progress
The MasterAgent will:
1. Read your project's architecture (`CLAUDE.md`)
2. Create a detailed plan (`MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md`)
3. Delegate tasks to specialized agents
4. Coordinate development and integration
5. Ensure all quality gates are met
